# **✨My Projects✨**

Welcome to my repository showcasing the  projects I have completed during the three-month HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp! As a total beginner, I embarked on this journey to learn the fundamentals of data science and develop practical skills in analysing and interpreting data.  

## Overview♡
Throughout the bootcamp, I delved into various aspects of data science, from data exploration and visualisation to machine learning and NLP models. Each project presented unique challenges and opportunities for learning, allowing me to apply newly acquired knowledge and techniques in real-world scenarios.


## Projects♡  

## 1. Financial Calculator➗ 
* **Description**: Developed a finacial calculator to work out the ROI the user will receive based on a certain amount of investment. The calculator also finds out how much the user will pay in repayments for the purchase of a house.
* **Technologies used**:Python
* **Features**:
  * Simple and Compound interest
  * Bond repayments
  * Investment return calculation

## 2. NLP Capstone Project👩‍💻
***Description**: This capstone project explores the use of NLP techniques to analyse semantic similarities and polarity scores in customer reviews. The project aims to quantify the likeness between customer reviews and identify common themes and sentiments across different interactions. Measuring semantic similarities, allows the project to extract meaningful insights from the data.
* **Technologies used**:Python, Jupyter Notebook
*  **Features**:
   * NLP algorithims to preprocess and analyse textual data from customer reviews
   * Measures semantic similarities between reviews to identify common themes and sentiments.
   * Calculates polarity scores to determine the sentiment of customer feedback.
