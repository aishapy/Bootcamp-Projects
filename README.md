# **✨Aishapy's Projects✨**

Welcome to my repository showcasing the  projects I have completed during the three-month HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp! As a total beginner, I embarked on this journey to learn the fundamentals of data science and develop practical skills in analysing and interpreting data.  

## Overview♡
Throughout the bootcamp, I delved into various aspects of data science, from data exploration and visualisation to machine learning and NLP models. Each project presented unique challenges and opportunities for learning, allowing me to apply newly acquired knowledge and techniques in real-world scenarios.
